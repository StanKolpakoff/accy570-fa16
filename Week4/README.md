#Week 4: Overview #

## Introduction to Statistical Analysis ##

This week you will learn about basic statistical analysis by using
distribution functions and summary statistics. First, you will learn
about representing data by a distribution, and how summary statistics
can simplify this description. Next you will learn about more powerful
distributions functions, including ones generated directly from the data
like a probability mass function and a cumulative density function, as
well as more commonly used theoretical distributions that can be used to
approximate data. Finally, you will learn about visualization
distributions by using matplotlib and seaborn.

### Objectives ###

#####By the end of this lesson, you should be able to:######

- Understand the different summary statistics.
- Understand how to create and use mass and density functions to represent data sets.
- Understand how theoretical distributions can be used to approximate data sets.
- Understand how to visualize distributions by using Python.
