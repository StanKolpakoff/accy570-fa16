The lessons this week will focus on learning about data visualizations and data formats. First, you will learn how visualization masters enable others to _see_ data. Next, you will start using an iPython notebook to make data visualizations. In particular, you will learn how to make general plots, and how to create and interpret scatter plots by using the Matplotlib and Seaborn libraries. Finally, we will discuss the text data format, which will include the .csv and .txt files as well as JSON files, before concluding with a discussion on how to read and write XML documents.

#####By the end of this lesson, you should be able to:######

- Understand the power of strong visualizations
