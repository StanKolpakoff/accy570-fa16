# Week 9 Lesson 1 #
## Introduction to Regular Expressions ##

In this lesson, you will learn about regular expressions. First, you will learn about regular expressions as used by the `grep` command at a Unix prompt. Second, you will learn about Python regular expressions and how to use the ```re``` library in Python. 

###Objectives ###
By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

- Understand and be able to utilize regular expressions to better streamline searches through text.
- Utilize metacharacters and literal characters for grep searches.
- Understand how to use the ```sub, search, and compile``` functions within the re library.
- Understand how to structure verbose regular expressions.
- Understand how to effectively specify the position and structure of the string you are searching for by using ```\b, ^, $, \d, \D, ?, *, +, {n,m}, (a|b)```, etc.

### Time Estimate ###
