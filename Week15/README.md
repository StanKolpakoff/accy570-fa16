## Python Data Processing ##

In this week, you will learn to perform basic data science tasks by
using Python. First, you will learn about web pages, and how to programmatically extract data from a web page or even websites. Finally, you will learn how to write a Python program that extract data from a website, processes an XML-based file to encode this information, in order to generate a new type of visualization known as a Chloropeth.
