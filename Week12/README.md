#Week 12: Overview #

## Relational Databases and Functional Programming ##

This week we first conclude our introduction of relational databases by discussing SQL Data Manipulation Language (DML) commands, which is used to interact with data in a relational database system. Next, you will learn about functional programming. This programming paradigm employs functions to change the state of data, where the functions process input data and produce outputs, without changing the state of the rest of the program. Functional programming can result in high performance computations for certain types of problems, and can, therefore, be a useful skill to possess

### Objectives ###


#####By the end of this lesson, you should be able to:######

- Understand how to use SQL to interact with data in a SQLite database.
- Understand the basic concepts behind functional programming.
- Understand how to employ the `map`, `filter`, and `reduce` methods.
- Understand how to write and use lambda functions.
