# Week 1 Lesson 1 #
## Intro to Data Analytics ##

In this lesson you will learn about the history of Data Science and how Data Science, by nature, is a combination of many different disciplines. We will review course policies and the different course servers. Finally we will review the JupyterHub server and how to use IPython Notebooks.

###Objectives ###

By the end of this lesson, you will:

- Know the basics about the origin, development, and popularization about Data Science.
- Understand how different disciplines aquire, process, and understand data.
- Know how to use the different course servers
- Be able to work in an IPython Notebook

You could share with the class via a Moodle Discussion Forum post how
your discipline views _Data Science_.
