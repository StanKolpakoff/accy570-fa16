# Week 2 Lesson 1 #
## Python Data Structures ##

In this lesson, you will learn about the different built-in Python data structures. First, you will learn about strings and lists, how to perform operations on these objects, and how to call various elements inside of these objects. Next, you will learn about what dictionaries are, how to modify them, and what operations you can apply to them. Finally, you will learn about tuples, how they differ from lists, and how to manipulate them with functions and operations.

###Objectives ###

By the end of this lesson, you will:

- Understand what strings are. 
- Be able to manipulate strings within Python using various operators, such as ```in```, ```for``` loops and the ```if``` comparison operator.
- Understand what lists are, and how their output is organized.
- Understand how to call one element of a list
- Be able to manipulate lists using list operators.
- Know the difference between lists and dictionaries.
- Understand the key-value concept of dictionaries.
- Create your own dictionaries.
- Understand what a tuple is and how it is different from a list.
- Apply various functions and operators to a tuple.
