#Week 2: #
### Objectives ###

In this week, you will then delve into the wondrous world of lists, dictionaries, strings, and tuples, where you will learn what these things are, when to use them, how they differ from each other, and how to manipulate them to our liking. Next, you will learn about working with files from within a Python program. Finally, you will learn about two powerful Python data science libraries: Pandas and Numpy, which can simplify many complicated tasks and perform core data analytics tasks.


#####By the end of this lesson, you should be able to:######

- Effectively use the Basic Python data structures: list, dictionary, string, & tuple.
- Understand how to work with files from within a Python program
- Understand the benefit of using the Pandas and Numpy library and how to use them to simplify basic data analytic operations.
